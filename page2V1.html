        </h1>
        <p class = "bio"> We are students of Brooklyn Tech who strive to end homelessness in NYC. Born and raised in NYC, we have seen in real time how severe the homeless situation has become. On our way to school, we’d see individuals relegated to living in the subways as they have nowhere else to go. On the streets, we’d see others beg for change because the city had failed them in providing them with resources to gain financial stability. Some, even with their entire families, malnourished, weathering the elements, desperate for assistance. Everyone deserves a place they can call home.</p>
