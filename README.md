# FrontEndWebsite


Our website is meant to showcase the true horrors of homelessness in NYC. 
  We present ways for our audience to help in our cause of putting an end to homelessness. 
We multiple css selectors to adjust the margins of texts and to adjust to different screen sizes. 
We also used data from a trusted source to provide a table about the homeless. 
We created a form that collects answers through the backend. 
The form is meant for the audience to be able to send a message to fight for our cause. 
We include pictures on every page to remind the audience of the true epidemic of homelessness. 
Lastly, we have a picture gallery page that can adjust to the mobile screen.
