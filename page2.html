        </h1>
        <p class = "bio">We are students of Brooklyn Tech who strive to end homelessness in NYC. Born and raised in NYC, we have seen in real time, how severe the homeless situtaion is becoming. On my way to school I would see individuals treating the subway like their home, they have no where else to go. On the streets are those who beg for change becuase they have no one else to go to but strangers. There are even some with families on the street. Everyone deserves a place they can call home.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2> 
        <p class = "ps">
          Let's end homelessness together!
